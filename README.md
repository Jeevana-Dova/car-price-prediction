# car-price-prediction
This project focuses on predicting the resale price of cars using machine learning techniques. I implemented multiple models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to estimate car prices based on features such as mileage, age, fuel type, and transmission type.
